            <h3>Three main differences between Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0</h3>

            <div class="qa">
                  <ul> <!-- Changed from <ol> to <ul> -->
                      <li>
                          <strong>Web 1.0 (Static):</strong> Web 1.0 was the initial stage of the World Wide Web, where websites were primarily static and read-only. Users could only consume the content provided by website owners, with limited interaction or collaboration.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Web 2.0 (Interactive):</strong> Web 2.0 marked the transition to a more interactive and user-centric web, where users could actively contribute, collaborate, and share content. Social media, blogs, wikis, and user-generated content became prevalent.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Web 3.0 (Semantic):</strong> Web 3.0, also known as the Semantic Web, aims to make web data more machine-readable and understandable, enabling better integration, interoperability, and intelligent data processing. It focuses on decentralization, blockchain technology, and the concept of a more open and trustless internet.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                <p>For example, a simple search query in Web 1.0 would display static, pre-defined results, while in Web 3.0, the search could leverage semantic data and AI to provide more personalized, contextualized, and intelligent results based on the user's intent and preferences.</p>
