            <h3>Three main differences between Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0</h3>
        
            <div class="qa">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Web 1.0 (Static):</strong> Web 1.0 was the initial stage of the World Wide Web, where websites were primarily static and read-only. Users could only consume the content provided by website owners, with limited interaction or collaboration. The web was mainly used for information retrieval and one-way communication. Websites were built using basic HTML, and the content was manually updated by website administrators.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Web 2.0 (Interactive):</strong> Web 2.0 marked the transition to a more interactive and user-centric web, where users could actively contribute, collaborate, and share content. Social media, blogs, wikis, and user-generated content became prevalent. It enabled two-way communication and facilitated online communities and social networking. Web 2.0 technologies included AJAX, APIs, and rich internet applications (RIAs), allowing for dynamic content and improved user experiences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Web 3.0 (Semantic):</strong> Web 3.0, also known as the Semantic Web, aims to make web data more machine-readable and understandable, enabling better integration, interoperability, and intelligent data processing. It focuses on decentralization, blockchain technology, and the concept of a more open and trustless internet. Web 3.0 utilizes technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and semantic data to provide more personalized, contextualized, and intelligent experiences for users. It also incorporates concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT) and decentralized applications (DApps).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, a simple search query in Web 1.0 would display static, pre-defined results, while in Web 2.0, the search results could be influenced by user interactions and social signals, such as user reviews, ratings, and social media shares. In Web 3.0, the search could leverage semantic data and AI to provide more personalized, contextualized, and intelligent results based on the user's intent and preferences, as well as the broader context and meaning of the query. It could also incorporate data from various sources, including IoT devices and decentralized applications, to deliver a more comprehensive and tailored experience.</p>
